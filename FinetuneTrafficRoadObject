## Project Content:

### 1. Model Overview:
- **Base Model**: Vision-Language Transformer (e.g., CLIP, ViT)
- **Purpose**: To detect and classify objects in traffic road scenes, providing descriptive labels for each detected object.
- **Architecture**: The model retains its transformer architecture for processing visual inputs and generating corresponding text descriptions, with a modified classification head for traffic-specific objects.

### 2. Fine-Tuning Process:
- **Data Preparation**: Images were preprocessed and augmented to improve the model's ability to handle diverse traffic conditions.
- **Model Architecture Adjustments**:
  - The final classification layer was re-trained to focus on detecting traffic-specific objects.
- **Training**:
  - Loss Functions: Cross-entropy for classification and contrastive loss for aligning visual and textual representations.
  - Optimization: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
  - Training Duration: 50 epochs with early stopping based on validation performance.

### 3. Evaluation:
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: 92% in traffic object detection.
  - **Other Metrics**: Precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to measure the model's performance across different traffic scenarios.
- **Outcome**: The model demonstrates strong performance in diverse traffic environments, ensuring reliability and accuracy in real-time applications.

### 4. Inference and Usage:
- **Applications**:
  - Real-time traffic monitoring systems.
  - Autonomous vehicles.
  - Smart city infrastructure.
- **Capabilities**: Detects multiple objects in a single image and provides detailed descriptions, suitable for safety-critical and time-sensitive deployments.

### 5. Key Features:
- **Robustness**: Effective under varying conditions.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to other datasets or larger systems.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for real-time processing.

### 6. Future Work:
- **Improvements**: Fine-tuning on more diverse datasets, integrating additional context (e.g., GPS data), and exploring advanced architectures for better performance.
