# Fine-Tuned Vision Language Model for Traffic Road Object Detection

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Vision-Language Transformer model, such as CLIP or ViT, specifically for traffic road object detection. Utilizing the Traffic Road Object Detection - Polish 12k dataset, the model has been optimized to accurately identify and classify traffic-related objects like vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. The fine-tuning process involved modifying the modelâ€™s classification head and applying domain-specific data augmentations. The resulting model is robust, capable of operating under various traffic conditions, and suitable for real-time applications in autonomous driving and traffic monitoring systems. Licensed under Apache 2.0, it is open for both academic and commercial use.
