# Fine-Tuned Vision Language Model for Traffic Road Object Detection

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Vision-Language Transformer model, such as CLIP or ViT, specifically for traffic road object detection. Utilizing the Traffic Road Object Detection - Polish 12k dataset, the model has been optimized to accurately identify and classify traffic-related objects like vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. The fine-tuning process involved modifying the model’s classification head and applying domain-specific data augmentations. The resulting model is robust, capable of operating under various traffic conditions, and suitable for real-time applications in autonomous driving and traffic monitoring systems. Licensed under Apache 2.0, it is open for both academic and commercial use.

# Introduction
This project focuses on fine-tuning a Vision-Language Model that incorporates the OpenAI GPT-4o mini for traffic road object detection. The goal is to develop a robust system capable of identifying and classifying objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and road markings in diverse traffic conditions. The combination of a powerful visual encoder with GPT-4o mini's advanced language processing capabilities allows for the generation of rich, descriptive labels that enhance the understanding of complex traffic scenes. This project is particularly relevant for real-time applications in autonomous driving and traffic monitoring systems.

# Base Model
The project leverages the following pre-trained models:

Visual Encoder: CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) or a similar Vision Transformer model, which processes the visual inputs.
Language Model: OpenAI GPT-4o mini
Architecture: Transformer-based language model.
Capabilities: Provides advanced text generation and understanding, which is crucial for producing accurate and contextually relevant descriptions of detected traffic objects.
